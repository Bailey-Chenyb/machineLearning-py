## Description
The aim of the game 2048 is to continually combine tiles until a tile of value 2048 is achieved at which point it is “won”. T

The goal of this project is to evaluate two representations (vector representation and binary vector) using three RL algorithms (Monte Carlo using state value functions, Monte Carlo using action value functions and Q-learning using action value functions) to learn to play the game of 2048 and analyse which learns a successful policy in the least number of episodes.
